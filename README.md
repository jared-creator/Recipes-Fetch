### Focus Areas:
I chose to focus mostly on the network usage and the design. They both play a huge part in how to app feels to the user, since the app itself is simple I chose to keep the ui simple but pleasant. 

### Time Spent:
I approximately spent about two days building this project. I spent the first day building the app and the second day going over any small mistakes and fine tuning the experience. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions:
I had to reel myself back whenever I wanted to increase the scope of the project. I was thinking of making more screens but with limited data and not wanting to prolong development time I focused on building the core app.

### Weakest Part of the Project: 
I think the weakest part is the unit tests. This is something I could've spent more time on and improved my skills on. 

### Additional Information: 
Not something big but I spent a good part of my first day pulling hair out becuase of a bug when I simply forgot to call a function.
